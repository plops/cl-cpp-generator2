You can install the packages required for Qt 6 development in Fedora using the DNF package manager. Here's how:

```
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel \
 qt6-qtmultimedia-devel qt6-qttools-devel 
```

Q: Show modern C++ code that opens a file containing two columns of
numbers (time and CO2 Concentration) and draws a graph in a QT6
Window.

A: Here's an example of modern C++ code that uses Qt6 to open a file
containing two columns of numbers, representing time and CO2
concentration, and then displays the data in a graph inside a Qt6
window:

```c++

#include <QApplication>
#include <QFile>
#include <QTextStream>
#include <QtCharts/QChartView>
#include <QtCharts/QLineSeries>
#include <QtWidgets/QMainWindow>

QT_CHARTS_USE_NAMESPACE

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Create a new Qt application
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    // Create a new Qt window
    QMainWindow window;
    window.resize(800, 600);
    window.setWindowTitle("CO2 Concentration vs. Time");

    // Create a new Qt chart
    QChart *chart = new QChart();
    chart->setTitle("CO2 Concentration vs. Time");

    // Create a new Qt line series to hold the data
    QLineSeries *series = new QLineSeries();

    // Open the data file and read in the time and CO2 concentration values
    QFile file("data.txt");
    if (!file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text)) {
        return 1;
    }

    QTextStream in(&file);
    while (!in.atEnd()) {
        QString line = in.readLine();
        QStringList values = line.split(" ");

        double time = values.at(0).toDouble();
        double concentration = values.at(1).toDouble();

        series->append(time, concentration);
    }

    file.close();

    // Add the line series to the chart
    chart->addSeries(series);

    // Set up the X and Y axes
    QValueAxis *axisX = new QValueAxis;
    axisX->setTitleText("Time");
    chart->addAxis(axisX, Qt::AlignBottom);
    series->attachAxis(axisX);

    QValueAxis *axisY = new QValueAxis;
    axisY->setTitleText("CO2 Concentration");
    chart->addAxis(axisY, Qt::AlignLeft);
    series->attachAxis(axisY);

    // Create a new Qt chart view to display the chart in the window
    QChartView *chartView = new QChartView(chart);
    chartView->setRenderHint(QPainter::Antialiasing);
    window.setCentralWidget(chartView);

    // Show the window and start the Qt event loop
    window.show();
    return app.exec();
}
```

This code uses the Qt6 framework to create a new Qt application and
window, load data from a file, and then display the data in a graph
using Qt charts. The code assumes that the data file has two columns
of numbers separated by a space, representing time and CO2
concentration, respectively. The data is loaded into a Qt line series
and then displayed on the chart, which is then displayed inside a Qt
chart view in the Qt window.

Q: Show how to install the dependencies in Fedora and the cmake file
to compile the program.

A: Assuming that you want to use the code example I provided in my
previous answer, here are the steps to install the necessary
dependencies on Fedora and create a CMake file to compile the program:

    Install Qt6 and the required libraries:

sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qtcharts-devel

This command installs the necessary Qt6 development libraries,
including qtbase, qtsvg, and qtcharts.

Create a CMake file to compile the program:

Create a new file named CMakeLists.txt in the same directory as your
source code file. Add the following code to the file:

```cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

project(my_project)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Core Gui Widgets Svg Charts REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_project main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE Qt6::Core Qt6::Gui Qt6::Widgets Qt6::Svg Qt6::Charts)
```

This CMake file sets the minimum required version of CMake, sets the
project name, sets the C++ standard to C++20, finds the necessary Qt6
components using find_package, creates an executable named my_project
from the main.cpp source file, and links the executable to the
required Qt6 libraries using target_link_libraries.

Create a build directory and build the project:

Create a new directory named build in the same directory as your
source code file. Change into the build directory and run the
following commands:

```go

cmake ..
make
```
These commands run the CMake build process to generate the necessary
build files, and then compile the program using the make command.

Run the program:

Once the program has been successfully compiled, you can run it using
the following command:

```bash
    ./my_project
```


    This command will execute the program, which will display the CO2
    concentration vs. time graph in a new window.

That's it! These steps should help you install the necessary
dependencies on Fedora and compile the program using CMake.
