## III. Equivalent-Time Sampling Implementation Strategies

This section will explore two primary strategies for implementing equivalent-time sampling on the STM32G4, outlining their methodologies and analyzing their respective strengths and weaknesses.

### 3.1 Software-Based Approach

The software-based approach relies on carefully orchestrated interactions between the HRTIM and ADC peripherals to achieve equivalent-time sampling. The core principle involves using HRTIM events to trigger ADC conversions at precise intervals across multiple repetitions of the input signal.

**Methodology:**

1. **Signal Synchronization:**  Ensure the repetitive input signal is synchronized with the HRTIM master timer. This can be achieved by using a trigger from the signal source to reset the master timer or by employing a phase-locked loop (PLL) to align the HRTIM clock with the signal frequency.
2. **Precise ADC Triggering:** Configure HRTIM compare events to generate triggers for the ADC. These events should be spaced at intervals corresponding to the desired equivalent-time sampling rate. For example, to achieve a 5.4GSps effective rate, the triggers should be 185 ps apart.
3. **Data Accumulation:**  Configure the ADC to operate in discontinuous mode and employ DMA to transfer the conversion results to a memory buffer. Over multiple signal cycles, accumulate samples triggered at progressively shifted time instances within the waveform.
4. **Signal Reconstruction:**  After acquiring sufficient samples, use software to reconstruct the high-resolution waveform by arranging the accumulated data points based on their trigger timing.

**Limitations:**

* **Resolution:** The achievable resolution is limited by the accuracy of the HRTIM compare events. While the DLL provides 184 ps resolution at 170 MHz, achieving the theoretical 5.4GSps might be challenging due to internal propagation delays and potential jitter.
* **Signal Bandwidth:**  The maximum input signal bandwidth is restricted by the minimum achievable spacing between ADC triggers.  Higher equivalent-time sampling rates demand shorter trigger intervals, limiting the maximum signal frequency.
* **CPU Overhead:** This approach requires significant CPU intervention for managing the HRTIM, ADC, and DMA, potentially impacting real-time performance for other tasks.

### 3.2 Hardware-Assisted Approach

Hardware-assisted approaches aim to overcome some of the limitations of the software-based method by employing external circuitry to aid in signal capture and conversion. 

#### 3.2.1 External OpAmp

Using a high-speed external OpAmp can improve equivalent-time sampling by amplifying the input signal and reducing the effective output impedance of the signal source. This allows for faster charging of the ADC's internal sampling capacitor, potentially enabling shorter sampling times.

**Methodology:**

1. **OpAmp Configuration:** Configure a high-speed OpAmp (e.g., LMH6645) in voltage follower mode to buffer the input signal. 
2. **Sampling Time Reduction:** Select a shorter sampling time for the ADC, taking into account the OpAmp's settling time and slew rate. This can significantly increase the achievable equivalent-time sampling rate.

**Advantages:**

* **Increased Speed:**  By decreasing the effective source impedance, the OpAmp allows for faster ADC sampling, enhancing the maximum achievable equivalent-time sampling rate.
* **Reduced Jitter:** A high-bandwidth OpAmp can minimize jitter on the signal, leading to more accurate sampling.

**Disadvantages:**

* **OpAmp Bandwidth Limitations:**  The OpAmp's bandwidth still imposes a constraint on the maximum signal frequency that can be accurately sampled.
* **Additional Components:**  This approach requires an external OpAmp and associated passive components, potentially increasing cost and complexity.

#### 3.2.2 Sample-and-Hold Circuit

A dedicated external sample-and-hold circuit can offer the most precise signal capture for equivalent-time sampling. This circuit captures the input signal at precisely timed instances defined by HRTIM triggers, holding the sampled voltage until the ADC can perform a conversion at a lower rate.

**Methodology:**

1. **Sample-and-Hold Design:** Implement a high-speed sample-and-hold circuit using specialized ICs or discrete components. The circuit should be capable of accurately capturing the input signal within the desired time resolution.
2. **Trigger Synchronization:** Connect HRTIM compare events to trigger the sample-and-hold circuit. These triggers should be spaced according to the targeted equivalent-time sampling rate.
3. **ADC Conversion:** Configure the ADC to convert the held voltage from the sample-and-hold circuit at a rate compatible with its native performance.
4. **Data Accumulation and Reconstruction:** Similar to the software-based approach, accumulate samples from consecutive signal cycles and use software to reconstruct the high-resolution waveform.

**Advantages:**

* **Highest Resolution:**  By isolating the sampling process from the ADC conversion, this approach can achieve the highest possible time resolution, limited only by the performance of the sample-and-hold circuit.
* **Increased Bandwidth:** The maximum signal bandwidth is determined by the sample-and-hold circuit's speed, potentially exceeding the limitations imposed by the ADC's sampling time.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Increased Complexity:** Designing and implementing a high-speed, accurate sample-and-hold circuit can be challenging and require specialized expertise.
* **Higher Cost:** This approach typically involves additional components and potentially more complex PCB layout, leading to increased cost.

#### 3.2.3 Comparative Analysis

The choice between software-based and hardware-assisted approaches depends on the specific application requirements. Table X summarizes the trade-offs:

| Approach | Resolution | Bandwidth | Complexity | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Software-Based | Limited by HRTIM accuracy | Limited by ADC trigger spacing | Moderate | Lower |
| External OpAmp | Enhanced by faster sampling | Limited by OpAmp bandwidth | Moderate | Moderate |
| Sample-and-Hold | Highest, limited by S/H circuit | Highest, limited by S/H circuit | High | Higher |

For applications demanding the highest possible time resolution and bandwidth, a hardware-assisted approach with a sample-and-hold circuit is preferred. However, if the required resolution and bandwidth are within the capabilities of the HRTIM and a fast external OpAmp, these methods offer simpler implementations with lower cost and complexity. 

Ultimately, careful analysis of the application's specific needs will guide the selection of the most suitable equivalent-time sampling strategy.
