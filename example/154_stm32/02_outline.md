* **HRTIM Overview:** Summarize relevant HRTIM features (clock, resolution, timers, outputs, events, DMA, ADC triggers) from [8, 9].
* **Limitations:**  Discuss specific constraints from the review:
    * Minimum ADC sampling time (42 ns).
    * External OpAmp bandwidth requirements for high-speed signals.
    * Potential for jitter due to APB clock limitations.

**III. Equivalent-Time Sampling Implementation Strategies**

* **Software-Based Approach:**
    * Describe a method utilizing HRTIM events for precise ADC trigger timing across multiple signal cycles.
    * Discuss limitations in terms of achievable resolution and signal bandwidth.

    * **External OpAmp:**  Present a configuration using a high-speed OpAmp to amplify and buffer the signal, allowing shorter sampling times. 
    * **Sample-and-Hold Circuit:**  Introduce the concept of a dedicated external sample-and-hold circuit for capturing the signal at precise moments, then converting it at a lower rate.
    * **Comparative Analysis:**  Discuss advantages and disadvantages of each hardware-assisted approach.

**IV. Practical Considerations and Optimizations**

* **Power Supply:** Emphasize the importance of a clean, linear power supply (from [4]) for accurate measurements.
* **Reference Voltage Decoupling:**  Highlight the need for proper decoupling of VREF+ and VSSA (from [1, 2, 4]) to minimize noise.
* **PCB Layout:** Stress the importance of separating analog and digital circuitry (from [4]) and minimizing track inductance (from [1]).
* **ADC Calibration:**  Recommend performing offset and gain calibration (from [4, 7]) for improved accuracy.
* **Noise Mitigation:**  Discuss techniques for reducing internal CPU noise during ADC conversion (from [4]).
* **Signal Conditioning:**  Suggest using the STM32G4's internal OpAmps (from [5]) for signal buffering and amplification where applicable.
* **Debugging Techniques:**  Showcase the method from [9] for verifying ADC sampling point placement using PWM outputs as a DAC.
