## STM32 Board Connection Description (Based on 01-Blink.ioc)

This description outlines the clock configuration and essential connections for an STM32 board running the 01-Blink project, utilizing the provided .ioc file data.

**Clock Configuration:**

* **System Clock (SYSCLK):** 170 MHz
    * Source: PLLCLK (PLL output)
* **High-Speed External Clock (HSE):** 8 MHz (from external oscillator)
* **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL):**
    * Source: HSE (8 MHz)
    * PLLM (Division Factor): 2 (HSE / 2 = 4 MHz)
    * PLLN (Multiplication Factor): 85 (4 MHz * 85 = 340 MHz)
    * VCO Output: 340 MHz
    * PLLP Output: 170 MHz (340 MHz / 2)
* **AHB Clock:** 170 MHz
* **APB1 Clock:** 170 MHz
* **APB2 Clock:** 170 MHz
* **Low-Speed Internal Clock (LSI):** 32 kHz
* **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** 32.768 kHz
    * Source: LSE (assumed to be connected and configured)

**Connections:**

* **Oscillators:**
    * **HSE:** Connect an 8 MHz crystal oscillator to the HSE pins of the STM32 microcontroller. Ensure proper capacitors are used according to the microcontroller's datasheet.
    * **LSE:** If using an external 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator for the RTC, connect it to the LSE pins of the microcontroller. Use appropriate capacitors as per the datasheet.
* **Power:**  Provide appropriate power supply to your STM32 board, on this board it is 5V
