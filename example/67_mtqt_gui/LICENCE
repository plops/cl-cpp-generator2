This library is gpl with the following additional requirement, which if neccessary supersceeds the gpl provisions. 

The requirement is: The full source of any derived work must be made available freely and publically available to all, both users and non users, along with this licence. 

That is, you cannot hide the sources behind only providing a cloud service which uses this library or only use it internally in an organisation.

There are commercial licences available.
Parts of this library are also available under other less restrictive open source licences. If you want to use some part in an opensource app, lets talk. 


Any individual file may be marked with a different licence, in which case that applies only to that file.
If such a licence would normally apply to this library as a derived work, I as copyright holder grant myself an exeption to this, meaning these licences do not propagate to the rest of the library.
