- comment about smart pointers
  - i just read the part about smart pointers in the book. i would
    like to use them but qt can't support them
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10334511/why-do-c-libraries-and-frameworks-never-use-smart-pointers
    biggest reason is probably the lack of a standard C++ Application
    Binary Interface (ABI).
- maybe i should look into imgui again
