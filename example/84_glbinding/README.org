 glbinding leverages C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and
 variadic templates, instead of relying on macros; all OpenGL symbols
 are real functions and variables. It provides type-safe parameters,
 per-feature API headers,

 created by CG Internals and the Computer Graphics Systems Group at
 the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Germany.
