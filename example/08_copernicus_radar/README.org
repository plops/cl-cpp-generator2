| gen00 |        0 | decode space packet data and header information         |
| gen01 |        1 | visualize decoded calibration and echo data with python |
| gen02 |        1 | try doppler decoding of raw data                        |
| gen03 |        1 | use numba and cupy to compute convolution on gpu        |

    - Japanese Synspective 25 SAR satellites, 1m-3m resolutino
    - US GeoEye-1 WorldView-2 50cm resolution
    - Japanese iQPS 36 SAR satellites, any point within 10min, fixed
      point observations of particular areas every 10min
  - combine two applications:
    - track usage of parking space
    - predict seriousness of flood damage
      - rivers are steep in japan, rain is increasing
  - earth surface 510_100_000 km^2
  - with 50cm resolution, several PB raw data for whole earth
  - potentially every 10min
  - too much to be transmitted, compute power in the world is
    insufficient to utilize full potential of sar satellites
  - limit to local area
