Does nvcc that comes with CUDA 1.1 already support C++11?

The version of nvcc that comes with CUDA 1.1 does not support C++11. The first version of nvcc that added support for C++11 was CUDA 5.0, which was released in 2013.

If you are using CUDA 1.1, you will need to use an older version of the C++ standard, such as C++98 or C++03. You can specify the version of the C++ standard to use by adding the appropriate flag to the nvcc command. For example, to use C++98, you can use the following command:


#+end_example
