** Protobuf

What is Google Protobuf?

Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a data serialization format
developed by Google for efficient data exchange between networked
systems. It is designed to be extensible, efficient, and
language-independent. Data is encoded in a binary format, rather than
in XML or JSON, which can make it more compact and faster to
process. Google provides libraries for working with Protobuf in many
programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and C#.





How does Protobuf deal with versioning of the communication protocol?
Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) deals with versioning of the
communication protocol through a feature called backwards
compatibility. This means that if a new field is added to a message,
or if the data type of a field is changed, the new version of the
message can still be parsed and understood by systems using the old
version of the message.

This is achieved by using unique field numbers for each field in a
message. When a new field is added, it is assigned a new field number,
and old systems that do not recognize the new field number will simply
ignore it. Similarly, if the data type of a field is changed, the new
version of the field will be assigned a new field number, and old
systems will continue to use the old field number.

It's worth noting that protobuf doesn't have any built-in mechanism to
handle breaking changes which can't be handled by the aforementioned
approach. It's up to the developer to handle such changes by using
different message types, different service methods or custom options.





Do you know any rules-of-thumb how to design the protocol, so that
breaking changes are possible later?  

Here are a few rules of thumb for designing a communication protocol
using Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) that allows for breaking
changes to be made later:

Reserve field numbers: When defining your messages, reserve a range of
field numbers for future use. This will allow you to add new fields to
your messages without having to change the field numbers of existing
fields.

Use oneof and/or optional fields: The oneof and optional fields can be
used to add new fields or change the data type of a field without
breaking backwards compatibility.

Create new message types: Instead of making breaking changes to
existing message types, create new message types for the new version
of the protocol. This way, old systems will continue to use the old
message types, while new systems can use the new message types.

Use different service methods: Instead of changing the service method,
create a new service method for the new version of the protocol. This
way, old systems will continue to use the old service method, while
new systems can use the new service method.

Use custom options: Use custom options for handling breaking changes,
you can use custom options to indicate that certain fields or methods
are deprecated or have been replaced by new fields or methods.

It's important to note that while the above approach can make it
easier to introduce breaking changes to your protocol, it's not always
possible to make changes in a completely backwards compatible
way. Ultimately, it depends on the specific requirements of your
application and the nature of the changes you need to make.

** gRPC

How can gRPC handle errors?


gRPC uses the status object in the gRPC protocol to handle errors. The
status object includes an error code and a message that describes the
error. The error code is a numerical value that indicates the type of
error, and the message provides additional details about the
error. gRPC also allows for additional metadata to be sent along with
the status object, which can be used to provide more information about
the error. Additionally, gRPC supports the use of custom error codes,
which can be used to provide more fine-grained error handling.


What are some rules for gRPC service design that allow future updates?

Here are a few best practices for designing gRPC services that can be
easily updated in the future:

1. Use versioning: Versioning is essential to allow for updates to
   your service without breaking existing clients. You can use a
   versioning scheme like Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to keep track
   of changes to your service.

2. Avoid breaking changes: When making updates to your service, try to
   avoid breaking changes that will require clients to update their
   code. Instead, make changes that are backward compatible.

3. Use gRPC's built-in support for streaming: gRPC has built-in
   support for bidirectional streaming, which allows for updates to be
   pushed to clients without requiring a new request.

4. Avoid hard-coding client-specific details: Avoid hard-coding
   client-specific details like IP addresses or ports in your
   service. Instead, use a service discovery mechanism like DNS or a
   service registry.

5. Plan for extensibility: When designing your service, plan for
   extensibility by keeping your data structures and APIs
   flexible. This will make it easier to add new features or
   capabilities in the future.

6. Use compatibility test suite: It's a good practice to have a
   compatibility test suite which can be run against the new updates
   to make sure they do not break existing clients.
