** Protobuf

What is Google Protobuf?

Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a data serialization format
developed by Google for efficient data exchange between networked
systems. It is designed to be extensible, efficient, and
language-independent. Data is encoded in a binary format, rather than
in XML or JSON, which can make it more compact and faster to
process. Google provides libraries for working with Protobuf in many
programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and C#.





How does Protobuf deal with versioning of the communication protocol?
Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) deals with versioning of the
communication protocol through a feature called backwards
compatibility. This means that if a new field is added to a message,
or if the data type of a field is changed, the new version of the
message can still be parsed and understood by systems using the old
version of the message.

This is achieved by using unique field numbers for each field in a
message. When a new field is added, it is assigned a new field number,
and old systems that do not recognize the new field number will simply
ignore it. Similarly, if the data type of a field is changed, the new
version of the field will be assigned a new field number, and old
systems will continue to use the old field number.

It's worth noting that protobuf doesn't have any built-in mechanism to
handle breaking changes which can't be handled by the aforementioned
approach. It's up to the developer to handle such changes by using
different message types, different service methods or custom options.





Do you know any rules-of-thumb how to design the protocol, so that
breaking changes are possible later?  

Here are a few rules of thumb for designing a communication protocol
using Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) that allows for breaking
changes to be made later:

Reserve field numbers: When defining your messages, reserve a range of
field numbers for future use. This will allow you to add new fields to
your messages without having to change the field numbers of existing
fields.

Use oneof and/or optional fields: The oneof and optional fields can be
used to add new fields or change the data type of a field without
breaking backwards compatibility.

Create new message types: Instead of making breaking changes to
existing message types, create new message types for the new version
of the protocol. This way, old systems will continue to use the old
message types, while new systems can use the new message types.

Use different service methods: Instead of changing the service method,
create a new service method for the new version of the protocol. This
way, old systems will continue to use the old service method, while
new systems can use the new service method.

Use custom options: Use custom options for handling breaking changes,
you can use custom options to indicate that certain fields or methods
are deprecated or have been replaced by new fields or methods.

It's important to note that while the above approach can make it
easier to introduce breaking changes to your protocol, it's not always
possible to make changes in a completely backwards compatible
way. Ultimately, it depends on the specific requirements of your
application and the nature of the changes you need to make.

** gRPC

How can gRPC handle errors?


gRPC uses the status object in the gRPC protocol to handle errors. The
status object includes an error code and a message that describes the
error. The error code is a numerical value that indicates the type of
error, and the message provides additional details about the
error. gRPC also allows for additional metadata to be sent along with
the status object, which can be used to provide more information about
the error. Additionally, gRPC supports the use of custom error codes,
which can be used to provide more fine-grained error handling.


What are some rules for gRPC service design that allow future updates?

Here are a few best practices for designing gRPC services that can be
easily updated in the future:

1. Use versioning: Versioning is essential to allow for updates to
   your service without breaking existing clients. You can use a
   versioning scheme like Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to keep track
   of changes to your service.

2. Avoid breaking changes: When making updates to your service, try to
   avoid breaking changes that will require clients to update their
   code. Instead, make changes that are backward compatible.

3. Use gRPC's built-in support for streaming: gRPC has built-in
   support for bidirectional streaming, which allows for updates to be
   pushed to clients without requiring a new request.

4. Avoid hard-coding client-specific details: Avoid hard-coding
   client-specific details like IP addresses or ports in your
   service. Instead, use a service discovery mechanism like DNS or a
   service registry.

5. Plan for extensibility: When designing your service, plan for
   extensibility by keeping your data structures and APIs
   flexible. This will make it easier to add new features or
   capabilities in the future.

6. Use compatibility test suite: It's a good practice to have a
   compatibility test suite which can be run against the new updates
   to make sure they do not break existing clients.


Is gRPC commonly used to communicate with Javascript code in the
browser?

gRPC is not commonly used to directly communicate with JavaScript code
in the browser because it is based on the HTTP/2 protocol, which is
not natively supported by most web browsers. However, it is possible
to use gRPC in a JavaScript client through the use of a gRPC-Web
library, which provides a JavaScript client library that can be used
to call gRPC services from the browser.

gRPC-Web is a JavaScript client library for gRPC, which allows browser
clients to communicate with gRPC servers via a proxy. The gRPC-Web
client calls are translated by the proxy into gRPC HTTP/2 calls. This
allows web developers to use gRPC to communicate with backend
services, while using the same idiomatic JavaScript API they would use
to communicate over HTTP/1.1.

It's worth noting that gRPC-Web is not a part of gRPC project and it's
maintained by a different team, also it's still considered an
experimental feature.



Does Chrome support HTTP/2 and gRPC?


Yes, Chrome supports HTTP/2 and gRPC. Chrome has supported HTTP/2
since version 41, which was released in April 2015. HTTP/2 is an
update to the HTTP protocol that improves the performance of web
applications by reducing the latency of network requests.

gRPC, which is based on HTTP/2, is also supported by Chrome. However,
as I mentioned in the previous answer, gRPC is not natively supported
by most web browsers, so in order to use gRPC with a JavaScript client
in the browser, developers will need to use a gRPC-Web library to
communicate with the gRPC services via a proxy.

It's worth noting that even though Chrome supports gRPC, it's not
advisable to use it to directly communicate with the browser, due to
the fact that gRPC is meant to be used in a more controlled
environment, such as a microservices architecture, where you have more
control over the client and server environments.


What is a well known opensource project that uses gRPC?


One well-known open-source project that uses gRPC is Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for
automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
applications. It uses gRPC for communication between its various
components, including the API server, etcd, and the kubelet.

gRPC provides Kubernetes with a high-performance, low-latency
communication channel that allows the different components of the
system to work together efficiently. Additionally, gRPC's support for
bi-directional streaming and flow control allows Kubernetes to handle
large numbers of simultaneous connections and handle high levels of
network traffic.

Other well-known open-source projects that use gRPC include Istio,
Envoy, and etcd, to name a few.


Are there examples that have nothing to do with cloud infrastructure?

Yes, there are many examples of open-source projects that use gRPC and
have nothing to do with cloud infrastructure. Here are a few examples:

1. Prometheus: Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and
   alerting system. It uses gRPC to expose metrics and allows for the
   collection of metrics from remote services.

2. Etcd: etcd is a distributed key-value store, often used as a
   consistent data storage for microservices. It uses gRPC for
   communication between the different nodes in the cluster.

3. grpc-health-probe: grpc-health-probe is a simple Go library for
   health checking gRPC servers. It uses gRPC to check the health of a
   server by sending a request to the server's Health checking
   service.

4. gRPC-Go: gRPC-Go is the Go implementation of gRPC. It allows
   developers to build gRPC services and clients in Go.

5. gRPC-Java: gRPC-Java is the Java implementation of gRPC. It allows
   developers to build gRPC services and clients in Java.

These are just a few examples, gRPC is widely used in different
domains like finance, gaming, retail and more. gRPC's
high-performance, low-latency communication makes it a good choice for
a wide range of applications that need to handle large amounts of data
or many concurrent connections.



Can Wireshark decode pRPC messages (assuming the proto files are available)?

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer tool that can be used to
inspect and analyze network traffic. It can decode a wide variety of
network protocols, including HTTP, DNS, and many others.

Wireshark can also decode gRPC messages, as long as the Protocol
Buffer (proto) files that define the messages are available. The
Wireshark gRPC dissector plugin uses the proto files to decode the
messages and make them human-readable.

The gRPC dissector plugin for Wireshark can be installed from the
Wireshark's website or from the Wireshark's plugin installer. Once the
plugin is installed, you will be able to see the gRPC messages in
Wireshark's packet list and inspect the details of the message in the
packet details window.

It's worth noting that Wireshark is only able to decode gRPC messages
that are sent over HTTP/2. If a different protocol is used, Wireshark
will not be able to decode the messages.
