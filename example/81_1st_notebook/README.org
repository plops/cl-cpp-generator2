- after i managed to build cling and install xeus-cling, i want to try
  to work with c++ notebooks

- in order to load notebook on fedora:
#+begin_example
export PATH=/tmp/cling-obj/bin:$PATH
cd /home/martin/stage/cl-cpp-generator2/example/81_1st_notebook/source
pip3 install --user jupyterlab
jupyter-lab
# jupyter notebook
#+end_example
