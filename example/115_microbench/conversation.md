Q: chipsandcheese.com has articles that describe CPU
architectures. They show matrices to explain the load/store
performance. How are these matrices measured?

A: The matrices used to explain load/store performance in the CPU
architectures described on chipsandcheese.com are typically based on
microbenchmarks and synthetic tests. These tests measure the time it
takes for the CPU to perform a specific load or store operation, and
the results are then used to construct the matrices. These matrices
can provide an overall picture of the CPU's performance, but it's
important to keep in mind that they are only one aspect of the CPU's
performance and might not always reflect real-world performance in all
cases.

Q: Show code for such a microbenchmark.

A: Here is an example of a simple microbenchmark in C that measures the
time it takes to perform a load operation:

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <x86intrin.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE (1024 * 1024)
#define ITERATIONS 10000

int main(void) {
  int i, j;
  int sum = 0;
  int array[ARRAY_SIZE];

  // Initialize the array with some data
  for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
    array[i] = i;
  }

  // Start the clock
  unsigned long long start = __rdtsc();

  // Perform the load operation
  for (j = 0; j < ITERATIONS; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  }

  // Stop the clock
  unsigned long long end = __rdtsc();

  // Calculate the elapsed time
  unsigned long long elapsed = end - start;

  printf("Elapsed time: %llu cycles\n", elapsed);
  return 0;
}
```

This microbenchmark measures the time it takes to perform a series of
load operations on an array of size ARRAY_SIZE. The __rdtsc intrinsic
is used to measure the number of CPU cycles, which is a common way to
measure performance in microbenchmarks. Note that this is just one
example of a microbenchmark, and the specific measurement method may
vary depending on the architecture and the system being tested.


Q: Use modern C++.

A: Here is the same microbenchmark implemented in modern C++:

```c

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

constexpr int ARRAY_SIZE = 1024 * 1024;
constexpr int ITERATIONS = 10000;

int main() {
  std::vector<int> array(ARRAY_SIZE);

  // Initialize the array with some data
  for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
    array[i] = i;
  }

  // Start the clock
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  int sum = 0;
  // Perform the load operation
  for (int j = 0; j < ITERATIONS; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  }

  // Stop the clock
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  // Calculate the elapsed time
  auto elapsed = end - start;

  std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << elapsed.count() << " nanoseconds\n";

  return 0;
}
```

This code uses the chrono library to measure the elapsed time in
nanoseconds. It also uses modern C++ features such as constexpr,
vector, and range-based for loops. Note that this is just one example
of a microbenchmark, and the specific measurement method may vary
depending on the architecture and the system being tested.

Q: Use std::array

A: Here is an updated version of the same microbenchmark using std::array:

```c

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

constexpr int ARRAY_SIZE = 1024 * 1024;
constexpr int ITERATIONS = 10000;

int main() {
  std::array<int, ARRAY_SIZE> array;

  // Initialize the array with some data
  for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
    array[i] = i;
  }

  // Start the clock
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  int sum = 0;
  // Perform the load operation
  for (int j = 0; j < ITERATIONS; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
      sum += array[i];
    }
  }

  // Stop the clock
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

  // Calculate the elapsed time
  auto elapsed = end - start;

  std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << elapsed.count() << " nanoseconds\n";

  return 0;
}
```

This code uses std::array instead of std::vector to store the
data. std::array is a fixed-size container that is used to store a
sequence of elements of a specified type. It provides similar
functionality to a C-style array but with added benefits, such as type
safety and a range of member functions for accessing and manipulating
the elements.
