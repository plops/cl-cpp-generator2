Can I add code that is licensed as "Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International" into my commercial project?

Yes, you can add code that is licensed under the "Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International" (CC BY-SA 4.0) into your commercial project, but with some conditions. The CC BY-SA 4.0 license requires that you provide attribution to the original author(s) of the code, and that you also license any modifications or additions you make to the code under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license. So, if you use code under this license in your commercial project, your commercial project must also be released under the same license or a compatible license.

If I just use a single file that contains a single C++ class, do I also have to release code that uses this class under CC BY-SA 4.0?

Yes, if you use a single file that is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license in your commercial project, then any code that incorporates or uses that file must also be released under the same license or a compatible license. This means that if you use the C++ class contained in the file, the code that uses that class must also be licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
