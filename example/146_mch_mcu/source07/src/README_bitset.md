To achieve the desired encapsulation and usability while replacing bit fields with `std::bitset<>`, you can utilize `std::bitset` for internal storage and create proxy objects for each member that need to be individually accessible. This approach allows for an easy-to-use interface while maintaining the control over read and write operations to emulate read-only and read-write members.  
   
However, it's important to note that `std::bitset` doesn't directly support partial bitset assignment or direct bit field-like access. To work around this, we can create a mechanism that simulates these features, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for the class users.  
   
Here's a conceptual implementation demonstrating how you might redesign the `Status` struct inside class `A`, using `std::bitset` and proxy objects:  
   
```cpp  
#include <bitset>  
#include <cstdint>  
#include <iostream>  
   
class A {  
public:  
    class Ctl {  
    private:  
        std::bitset<8> bits;  
  
        // Proxy object for individual bit access  
        class BitProxy {  
            std::bitset<8>& bits;  
            size_t position;  
  
        public:  
            BitProxy(std::bitset<8>& bits, size_t position) : bits(bits), position(position) {}  
  
            // Assignment operator for proxy, allows `proxy = value;`  
            BitProxy& operator=(bool value) {  
                bits.set(position, value);  
                return *this;  
            }  
  
            // Conversion to bool, allows `if (proxy)`  
            operator bool() const {  
                return bits.test(position);  
            }  
        };  
  
    public:  
        // Expose each bit as a proxy object  
        BitProxy enable{bits, 0};  
        BitProxy start_bit_align{bits, 1};  
        BitProxy bit_align_finished{bits, 2};  
        // Add more proxies as needed  
  
        // Print function for demonstration  
        void print(std::ostream& os) const {  
            os << "enable: " << bits.test(0) << std::endl;  
            os << "start_bit_align: " << bits.test(1) << std::endl;  
            os << "bit_align_finished: " << bits.test(2) << std::endl;  
        }  
    } ctl;  
  
    // You can similarly define `Status` with read-only and read-write members.  
};  
   
int main() {  
    A a;  
    // Directly set values using the proxy objects  
    a.ctl.enable = true;  
    a.ctl.start_bit_align = false;  
    a.ctl.bit_align_finished = true;  
  
    // Print all bits  
    a.ctl.print(std::cout);  
  
    return 0;  
}  
```  
   
In this design, each bit in the `Ctl` struct (and similarly for the `Status` struct, which you would need to implement following the same pattern) is represented by a `BitProxy` object. This proxy manages access to individual bits within the `std::bitset`, allowing you to assign and read individual bits as if they were direct members, e.g., `a.ctl.enable = true`, without "writing a lot of dots".  
   
This approach provides a balance between the usability you're looking for and the encapsulation/control that's necessary for managing access to bit fields, especially distinguishing between read-only and read-write access. Note that this pattern can be extended or modified to fit more complex scenarios, including handling read-only bits by not providing a public setter proxy for them.
