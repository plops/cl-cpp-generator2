# ISP592.h

A library for interacting with the flash memory (both program and data storage) of a CH592 microcontroller or similar device.

**Overall Purpose:**

* Provides a unified interface for the  following operations on the device's Flash-ROM (program storage) and Data-Flash (similar to EEPROM, for storing variables and data):
    * Erasing blocks of memory.
    * Writing data (with some size restrictions).
    * Reading data (for Flash-ROM, this is used as verification).

**Key Constants:**

* **EEPROM\_PAGE\_SIZE:**  Page size for Flash-ROM and Data-Flash writes (256 bytes).
* **EEPROM\_BLOCK\_SIZE:** Block size for erasing both Flash-ROM and Data-Flash (4096 bytes).
* **EEPROM\_MIN\_ER\_SIZE:** Minimum size for erasing Data-Flash (256 bytes).
* **EEPROM\_MIN\_WR\_SIZE:** Minimum size for writing Data-Flash (1 byte).
* **EEPROM\_MAX\_SIZE:** Maximum Data-Flash size (32 KB).
* **FLASH\_MIN\_WR\_SIZE:** Minimum size for writing Flash-ROM (4 bytes).
* **FLASH\_ROM\_MAX\_SIZE:** Maximum Flash-ROM program size (448KB).

**Commands (`CMD_*`)**

These commands can be used by code running either from Flash-ROM or RAM to directly control the memory.

* **Start I/O, Reset, Get Info:** Basic management and device information retrieval.
* **Power Down/Up:** For power management of the Flash-ROM.
* **Locking/Unlocking:** Protects areas of Flash-ROM from modification.
* **Erasing (EEPROM, Flash-ROM):** Clears areas of the memory.
* **Writing (EEPROM, Flash-ROM):**   Modifies the contents of memory.
* **Reading (EEPROM):** Retrieves data from Data-Flash memory.

**Functions**

The code offers user-friendly functions built on top of the basic commands:

* **FLASH_EEPROM_CMD:** The core function executing Flash/EEPROM commands.
* **GET_MAC_ADDRESS:**  Fetches the unique MAC address of the device.
* **GET_BOOT_INFO:** Retrieves boot-related information.
* **GET_UNIQUE_ID:**  Gets a 64-bit unique identifier for the device.
* **EEPROM_READ:**  Reads data from Data-Flash (EEPROM-like memory).
* **EEPROM_ERASE:**  Erases blocks of Data-Flash.
* **EEPROM_WRITE:** Writes data to Data-Flash.
* **FLASH_ROM_ERASE:** Erases blocks of Flash-ROM (program memory).
* **FLASH_ROM_WRITE:** Writes data to Flash-ROM.
* **FLASH_ROM_VERIFY:**  Verifies the contents of Flash-ROM against a provided buffer.



# CH592SFR.h

**CH592 Microcontroller Code Overview**

**Purpose**

The CH592 microcontroller code provides the core structure and functionality for interacting with and controlling the CH592, a RISC-V based microcontroller. The code defines essential constants, types, register mappings, and configurations for accessing hardware features including:

* Timers
* Input/Output (GPIO)
* Clock Management
* Power Management
* Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
* Real-Time Clock (RTC)
* Serial Communication (SPI, UART)
* USB
* ... and more

**Key Concepts**

* **Special Function Registers (SFRs):** The code directly maps names of microcontroller registers to their memory addresses, offering convenient control over different functions using defined bit masks.
* **Safe Accessing Mode (SAM):** Certain critical registers require precise sequences of writes to prevent accidental modification of sensitive system settings.
* **Power Management:** The code allows fine-grained control over which functions remain active in low-power sleep modes, enabling efficient operation based on application requirements.
* **Clock Management:** You can flexibly configure the microcontroller's clock system, including clock sources, PLL, and dividers. This determines the operating speed of the device.

**Overall Structure**

The CH592 code is organized into logical segments related to the following core areas:

* **System Management**
   * Watchdog Timer (IWDG) for preventing system lockups.
   * Configuration registers for access modes, reset behavior, and other global settings.
   * Clock configuration for setting system clock speed and sources.
   * Sleep mode controls for optimized power consumption.
* **Peripherals**
   * Input/Output (GPIO) pin mapping and mode selection.
   * ADC for converting analog signals to digital values.
   * RTC for timekeeping and alarms.
   * Touchkey for touch-based input detection.
   * UART for asynchronous serial communication.
   * SPI for synchronous serial communication.
   * USB device or host functionality.
* **Interrupts**
   * Definition of available interrupts, their numbers, and routing to handlers.
