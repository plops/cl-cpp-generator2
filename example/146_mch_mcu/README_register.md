# Intro

here i want to develop a structure of how to represent the registers of the MCU in modern c++


## Prompts for Gemini

propose a way to represent usb registers of an MCU in modern c++

The base address of the USB controller is 0x40008000 and the USB related registers are divided into 3 parts, some
of which are multiplexed in host and device mode.
(1) USB global registers.
(2) USB device control registers.
(3) USB host control registers. 

heres is the first register:

| Name        | Access address | Description          | Reset value |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| R8_USB_CTRL | 0x40008000     | USB control register | 0x06        |
|             |                |                      |             |

the contents of this register are:

| Bit   | Name             | Access |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| 7     | RB_UC_HOST_MODE  | RW     |
| 6     | RB_UC_LOW_SPEED  | RW     |
| 5     | RB_UC_DEV_PU_EN  | RW     |
| [5:4] | MASK_UC_SYS_CTRL | RW     |
| 3     | RB_UC_INT_BUSY   | RW     |
| 2     | RB_UC_RESET_SIE  | RW     |
| 1     | RB_UC_CLR_ALL    | RW     |
| 0     | RB_UC_DMA_EN     | RW     |
