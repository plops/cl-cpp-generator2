What is levenberg-markward
Levenberg-Marquardt is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the sum of the squares of nonlinear functions. It is a combination of the gradient descent method and the Newton-Raphson method, and is typically used in nonlinear least squares problems in which the goal is to find the best fit of a set of data points. It is particularly useful for problems in which the function to be minimized has many local minima.

Does it work for multiple dimensions?
Yes, Levenberg-Marquardt can be used to optimize multidimensional nonlinear functions. The algorithm can handle functions with many variables, and can be used to find the optimal values of those variables that minimize the sum of the squares of the nonlinear functions. The algorithm can be applied to a wide range of problems, including curve fitting, data fitting, and parameter estimation, among others. The implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is usually done in programming languages like C, C++, Matlab, Python etc.

Here is an example of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in Python:

￼Copy code
import numpy as np

def levenberg_marquardt(x0, f, df, args=(), k=1e-3, maxiter=100):
    """
    Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm
    :param x0: Initial guess for the optimization
    :param f: Objective function to be minimized
    :param df: Jacobian of the objective function
    :param args: Additional arguments for the objective function
    :param k: Damping factor
    :param maxiter: Maximum number of iterations
    :return: The optimized parameters, the objective function value at the optimized parameters, and the number of iterations
    """
    x = x0
    for i in range(maxiter):
        fx = f(x, *args)
        jac = df(x, *args)
        jacT = jac.T
        hessian = jacT.dot(jac)
        gradient = jacT.dot(fx)
        try:
            inv_hessian = np.linalg.inv(hessian + k*np.eye(len(x)))
        except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
            print("Singular matrix")
            break
        x_new = x - inv_hessian.dot(gradient)
        if np.allclose(x, x_new, rtol=1e-4):
            break
        x = x_new
    return x, f(x, *args), i+1

This is a basic example of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, it takes an initial guess x0, an objective function f, and the Jacobian of the objective function df, as inputs. Additionally, it accepts additional arguments for the objective function, a damping factor k, and the maximum number of iterations.

The algorithm iteratively updates the guess, x, until it finds a minimum. The optimization stops when the change in x between iterations is small enough or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

You can use this algorithm to optimize your own objective function by passing the proper function and Jacobian, and initial guess as inputs.

I believe the C++ library ceres can automatically compute differentials and jacobians. Is that correct?
Yes, that is correct. Ceres is a C++ library for non-linear optimization that can automatically compute differentials and Jacobians using a technique called Automatic Differentiation (AD). AD is a method for computing derivatives of a function specified by a computer program, without the need for symbolic or numerical differentiation. This is particularly useful when the function is complex and its analytical derivative is difficult or impossible to compute by hand.

Ceres uses AD to automatically generate the derivatives of the objective function, which are then used in optimization algorithms such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This makes it easy to use Ceres for a wide range of optimization problems without the need to manually compute and provide the derivatives of the objective function.

Ceres also supports a number of other optimization methods like Gradient Descent, Non-Linear Conjugate Gradient, and Trust Region methods. In addition to that, Ceres also supports other features like bundle adjustment, robust cost functions, and parallel computation, making it a comprehensive optimization library.

Implement LM in modern C++. Use ceres to compute the gradients or jacobians.
Here is an example of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in modern C++ using the Ceres library:

￼Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <ceres/ceres.h>

using namespace std;
using namespace ceres;

// Objective function to be minimized
struct MyCostFunctor {
    template <typename T>
    bool operator()(const T* const x, T* residual) const {
        // Define the non-linear function
        residual[0] = x[0] * x[0] + x[1] * x[1] - T(10.0);
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    double x[2] = {3.0, 4.0};  // Initial guess
    Problem problem;
    problem.AddResidualBlock(new AutoDiffCostFunction<MyCostFunctor, 1, 2>(new MyCostFunctor), nullptr, x);

    Solver::Options options;
    options.minimizer_type = ceres::TRUST_REGION;
    options.linear_solver_type = ceres::DENSE_QR;
    options.max_num_iterations = 100;
    options.trust_region_strategy_type = ceres::LEVENBERG_MARQUARDT;

    Solver::Summary summary;
    Solve(options, &problem, &summary);

    cout << "x = [" << x[0] << ", " << x[1] << "]" << endl;
    cout << "Iterations: " << summary.iterations.size() << endl;
    cout << "Final cost: " << summary.final_cost << endl;
    return 0;
}
This example defines a simple non-linear objective function, MyCostFunctor, which is then added to the problem with problem.AddResidualBlock(new AutoDiffCostFunction<MyCostFunctor, 1, 2>(new MyCostFunctor), nullptr, x). The AutoDiffCostFunction template automatically computes the gradients of the objective function using AD. The initial guess for the optimization is given by x, and the problem is solved using the Solve function from Ceres.

The options for the solver are set to use a trust region method with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for optimization, and a dense QR linear solver. The maximum number of iterations is set to 100.

This is a basic example of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in Ceres, it can be further enhanced by adding more functionality to the objective function, or by adjusting the solver options to suit the specific problem.

I want you to implement LM in modern C++. You don't need to write down  an implementation of the function f and df.
Sure, here is an example of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm implemented in modern C++:

￼Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>

using namespace std;
using namespace Eigen;

int main() {
    VectorXd x(2);
    x << 3.0, 4.0;  // Initial guess
    double lambda = 1e-3;  // Damping factor
    int maxiter = 100;

    for (int i = 0; i < maxiter; i++) {
        VectorXd fx = f(x);  // Compute the non-linear function
        MatrixXd jac = df(x);  // Compute the Jacobian of the function
        MatrixXd hessian = jac.transpose() * jac;
        VectorXd gradient = jac.transpose() * fx;
        MatrixXd inv_hessian = (hessian + lambda * MatrixXd::Identity(x.size(), x.size())).inverse();
        VectorXd x_new = x - inv_hessian * gradient;
        if ((x - x_new).norm() < 1e-4) {
            break;
        }
        x
