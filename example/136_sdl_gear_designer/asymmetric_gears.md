- The article focuses on the design and advantages of asymmetric gears using Direct Gear Design (DGD).
- In propulsion gear systems, asymmetric gears handle unidirectional torque more efficiently.
- Asymmetric gear design aims to improve the performance of the drive profiles while compromising the coast profiles, which are less utilized.
- Benefits of asymmetric gears include lower contact stress, higher torque density, and extended operating pressure angles and contact ratios.
- Unlike symmetric gears, asymmetric gears lack standardized design and sufficient analytical data.
- DGD is a method that brings practicality to the theoretical work on asymmetric gears, offering new ways to define asymmetric tooth profiles.
- Gear tooth parameters and mesh parameters are discussed, with specific formulae presented for different types of gearing.
- The tooth fillet profile is optimized to minimize bending stress, employing techniques like random search and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
- The article includes an example implementation: a two-stage planetary gearbox in the TV7-117S turboprop engine, used in various Russian airplanes.
- The article points out that most research so far has been on mathematical models and lab tests, with little focus on practical implementations.

- The article discusses the Direct Gear Design approach for asymmetric gear design in the TV7-117S turboprop engine gearbox.
- Higher operating pressure angles were chosen for sun-planet gear contact to comply with ANSI/AGMA 6123-B06 standard.
- Benefits include greater hydrodynamic oil film thickness, lower flash temperature, and reduced scuffing probability.
- The gearbox has a two-stage planetary-differential set-up with specific numbers of planet gears.
- Asymmetric tooth profiles improve load sharing, reduce gear noise, and increase stiffness.
- Gear material is specifically chosen steel 20KH3MVF, and custom gear cutters are needed for manufacturing.
- Gears are carburized and heat-treated for surface hardness.
- Planet gears are classified and assembled based on their Transmission Error (TE) function.
- The new design resulted in 50% lower weight to output torque ratio compared to predecessors, reduced noise, and cut operational development costs.
- The design approach is recommended for advanced aviation engines.
