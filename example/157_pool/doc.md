>>> implement in modern c++ a method to prevent memory fragmentation in a system that processes many images and allocates repeatedly big and small areas for various computations.
Memory fragmentation can be particularly problematic when dealing with systems that allocate and deallocate large amounts of memory, such as image processing tasks. To mitigate this issue, one effective strategy is to use memory pooling. Memory pools pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory and manage it in a way 
that minimizes fragmentation.

In modern C++, you can implement a simple memory pool using smart pointers and templates. Below is an example implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <cstdlib>

template <typename T>
class MemoryPool {
public:
    MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t numBlocks) : m_blockSize(blockSize), m_numBlocks(numBlocks) {
        allocatePool();
    }

    ~MemoryPool() {
        deallocatePool();
    }

    std::unique_ptr<T> allocate() {
        if (m_freeList.empty()) {
            throw std::bad_alloc();
        }
        auto ptr = std::move(m_freeList.back());
        m_freeList.pop_back();
        return ptr;
    }

    void deallocate(std::unique_ptr<T>&& ptr) {
        m_freeList.push_back(std::move(ptr));
    }

private:
    size_t m_blockSize;
    size_t m_numBlocks;
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>> m_pool;
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>> m_freeList;

    void allocatePool() {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < m_numBlocks; ++i) {
            m_pool.push_back(std::make_unique<T>(new char[m_blockSize]));
            m_freeList.push_back(std::move(m_pool.back()));
        }
    }

    void deallocatePool() {
        for (auto& block : m_pool) {
            delete[] static_cast<char*>(block.release());
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    MemoryPool<int> pool(sizeof(int), 100);

    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<int>> allocations;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 50; ++i) {
        allocations.push_back(pool.allocate());
    }

    // Deallocate some memory
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 25; ++i) {
        pool.deallocate(std::move(allocations[i]));
    }

    // Reallocate some memory
    for (size_t i = 50; i < 100; ++i) {
        allocations.push_back(pool.allocate());
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation:

1. **MemoryPool Class**:
   - `MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t numBlocks)`: Constructor that initializes the pool with a specific block size and number of blocks.
   - `~MemoryPool()`: Destructor that cleans up the allocated memory.
   - `std::unique_ptr<T> allocate()`: Allocates a new block from the pool. If no more blocks are available, it throws a `std::bad_alloc` exception.
   - `void deallocate(std::unique_ptr<T>&& ptr)`: Deallocates a block back to the pool.

2. **Private Methods**:
   - `allocatePool()`: Pre-allocates the memory pool and initializes the free list with all available blocks.
   - `deallocatePool()`: Frees up the allocated memory when the pool is destroyed.

3. **Usage Example**:
   - In the `main` function, a `MemoryPool<int>` is created with block size of `sizeof(int)` and 100 blocks.
   - Memory is allocated and deallocated multiple times to demonstrate the pool's functionality.

### Benefits:
- **Reduced Fragmentation**: The pool pre-allocates memory, reducing fragmentation that can occur when repeatedly allocating and deallocating small pieces.
- **Improved Performance**: Allocation and deallocation are faster since they operate on a fixed-size block rather than dynamically allocating each time.

This implementation provides a basic memory pooling mechanism. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you might need to extend or modify it further to handle more complex scenarios, such as varying block sizes or thread safety.
