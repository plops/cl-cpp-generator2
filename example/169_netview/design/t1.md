Okay, let's break down the architectural concept for your video streaming software.  I'll organize it into sections with files, classes, and their responsibilities. This structure emphasizes modularity, efficient data handling, and the requirements you've outlined (Cap'n Proto, AVCPP, GLFW/OpenGL, preloading).

**Architectural Concept Outline**

1.  **Cap'n Proto Schema Definition (`proto/video.capnp`)**

    *   **File:** `proto/video.capnp` (You have a good start on this)
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the data structures for communication between the client and server.  This is crucial for efficient serialization/deserialization.
    *   **Structures (Refined):**

        ```capnp
        @0xb1039f6a7c611b12;  # Unique ID (keep yours)

        struct VideoInfo {
          id @0 :UInt64;       # Unique ID for each video (e.g., hash of path)
          filePath @1 :Text;  # Relative or absolute path on the server
          fileName @2 :Text;    #filename
          fileSize @3 :UInt64;  # File size in bytes
          duration @4 :Float64; # Duration in seconds (obtained during server-side indexing)
          width @5 :UInt32;    # Video width
          height @6 :UInt32;   # Video height
          bitrate @7: UInt64;
        }

        struct VideoList {
          videos @0 :List(VideoInfo);
        }

        struct StreamRequest {
          videoId @0 :UInt64;
          startPts @1 :Int64;  # Presentation Timestamp (PTS) for seeking.  Use Int64 for consistency with FFmpeg.
          # Consider adding a duration or number of frames to request, for finer control
        }
        
        struct PacketData {
          streamIndex @0 :Int32;
          pts @1 :Int64;
          dts @2 :Int64;
          data @3 :Data;       # The raw packet data (encoded)
          isKeyFrame @4 :Bool;
          duration @5 :Int64;
        }


        struct StreamResponse {
          packets @0 :List(PacketData);
        }
        
        interface Server {
            getVideoList @0 () -> (videoList :VideoList);
            requestStream @1 (request :StreamRequest) -> (response :StreamResponse);
            #add ping to check connection
            ping @2 () -> ();
        }

        ```

    *   **Key Improvements:**
        *   `VideoInfo`: Includes more metadata (duration, resolution, bitrate) that the client can use without needing to fully decode the video.  This is *essential* for responsive UI and preloading decisions.
        *    `id`: added an unique id
        *   `StreamRequest`: Uses PTS for seeking, aligning with FFmpeg's internal representation.
        *   `PacketData` sends multiple packets inside a list.
        *   `Server` interface: Defines the RPC methods the server will expose.

2.  **Server Component (`src/server/`)**

    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/server/main.cpp`:  Server entry point, sets up networking, and instantiates the `ServerImpl`.
        *   `src/server/ServerImpl.h`, `src/server/ServerImpl.cpp`: Implements the Cap'n Proto server interface (the `Server` interface defined in `video.capnp`).  Handles client requests.
        *   `src/server/VideoIndex.h`, `src/server/VideoIndex.cpp`:  Responsible for scanning the video directory, extracting metadata (using AVCPP), and storing it in a readily accessible format (e.g., a `std::map` keyed by video ID).  This is the "pre-indexing" step.
        *   `src/server/StreamManager.h`, `src/server/StreamManager.cpp`: Manages the actual streaming of video data.  Handles reading from files, creating AVCPP `Packet` objects, and sending them to the client.  This class will handle the preloading logic.
        *   `src/server/PacketCache.h`, `src/server/PacketCache.cpp`: (Optional, but highly recommended for performance) A cache to store recently accessed packets.  This can significantly improve performance if the user jumps back and forth within a video.

    *   **Classes:**

        *   `VideoIndex`:
            *   `loadIndex(const std::filesystem::path& directory)`: Scans the directory, extracts metadata using AVCPP (see AVCPP example you provided - you'll need to adapt it to extract all the `VideoInfo` fields), and populates its internal data structure.  This should be done *once* at server startup.
            *   `getVideoInfo(uint64_t videoId) const -> std::optional<VideoInfo>`: Retrieves `VideoInfo` by ID.  Returns an `optional` to handle cases where the ID is invalid.
            *   `getVideoList() const -> VideoList`: Returns a Cap'n Proto `VideoList` object containing information about all indexed videos.
            *   `getVideoIds() const -> std::vector<uint64_t>`: get ids of available videos

        *   `StreamManager`:
            *   `StreamManager(const VideoIndex& index)`: Constructor, takes a reference to the `VideoIndex`.
            *   `requestStream(uint64_t videoId, int64_t startPts) -> StreamResponse`:  This is the core streaming function.  It:
                1.  Looks up the video in the `VideoIndex`.
                2.  Opens the video file using AVCPP.
                3.  Seeks to the requested `startPts` (using AVCPP's seeking functionality).
                4.  Reads a number of packets (the number should be configurable, and potentially adaptive based on network conditions).
                5.  Creates a `StreamResponse` Cap'n Proto object and populates it with the packet data.
                6.  Handles preloading (see below).
            *   `preload(uint64_t videoId, int64_t startPts)`:  Preloads packets for a given video.  This could be a separate thread or use asynchronous I/O.
            *   Internal data structures to track open files, current positions, and preloaded data.

        *   `ServerImpl`:
            *   Implements the `getVideoList()` and `requestStream()` methods defined in the Cap'n Proto interface.
            *   Uses the `VideoIndex` to respond to `getVideoList()`.
            *   Uses the `StreamManager` to respond to `requestStream()`.
            *   Handles Cap'n Proto connection setup and request dispatching.

        *   `PacketCache` (Optional):
            *   `put(uint64_t videoId, int64_t pts, const av::Packet& packet)`: Stores a packet.
            *   `get(uint64_t videoId, int64_t pts) -> std::optional<av::Packet>`: Retrieves a packet, if present.
            *   Uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar eviction policy.

    *   **Preloading Logic (in `StreamManager`):**
        *   When `requestStream` is called, *also* call `preload` for the next and previous videos in the playlist (you can get this information from the `VideoIndex`).
        *   `preload` should read a configurable number of packets (or a time duration) from the beginning of the neighboring files.
        *   Store preloaded packets either in a dedicated data structure within `StreamManager` or in the `PacketCache`.
        *   When switching to a new video, check if preloaded data is available *before* opening the file and seeking.

3.  **Client Component (`src/client/`)**

    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/client/main.cpp`: Client entry point, sets up networking, GLFW/OpenGL, and instantiates the `Client`.
        *   `src/client/Client.h`, `src/client/Client.cpp`:  Manages the connection to the server, handles user input (seeking, play/pause), and coordinates the decoding and rendering pipeline.
        *   `src/client/VideoDecoder.h`, `src/client/VideoDecoder.cpp`:  Wraps AVCPP's decoding functionality.  Takes `PacketData` from the server and produces decoded frames.
        *   `src/client/Renderer.h`, `src/client/Renderer.cpp`:  Handles the OpenGL rendering.  Takes decoded frames (as textures) and displays them.
        *   `src/client/PlaylistManager.h`, `src/client/PlaylistManager.cpp`: Manages playing video files in a particular order, handles preloading and communicates with the `StreamManager`
        *   `src/client/CapnProtoClient.h`, `src/client/CapnProtoClient.cpp`: wraps capnproto client rpc functionality
        *   `src/client/gl_helper.h`,`src/client/gl_helper.cpp`: helper functions for opengl operations

    *   **Classes:**

        *   `CapnProtoClient`:
            *   `connectToServer(const std::string& address)`
            *   `getVideoList() -> VideoList`
            *   `requestStream(uint64_t videoId, int64_t startPts) -> StreamResponse`
            *   `ping() -> void`

        *   `PlaylistManager`
            *   `PlaylistManager(CapnProtoClient & client)`: constructor to pass capnp client
            *   `setPlaylist(const std::vector<uint64_t> &videoIds)`: set the playlist via a vector of videoids
            *   `next()`, `previous()`: methods to switch to the next/previous video
            *   `getCurrentVideo() -> uint64_t`: Returns id of the current video file.
            *   `seek(int64_t pts)`: Seeks within the current video.
            *   `play()`, `pause()`: Controls playback.

        *   `Client`:
            *   `Client(const std::string& serverAddress)`: Constructor, takes the server address.
            *   `run()`: The main client loop.  Handles events, updates the decoder and renderer.
            *   `handleInput()`: Processes keyboard/mouse input (for seeking, play/pause, etc.).
            *   `update()`:  Called every frame.  Requests new packets from the server (via `StreamManager`), feeds them to the `VideoDecoder`, and passes decoded frames to the `Renderer`.
            *   `getVideoList()` calls capnp client to retrieve video list.
            *    creates `PlaylistManager` and `VideoDecoder`

        *   `VideoDecoder`:
            *   `decode(const PacketData& packetData) -> std::optional<av::VideoFrame>`: Decodes a single packet.  Returns an `optional` to handle the case where a packet doesn't produce a full frame (e.g., end of stream).  Uses AVCPP for decoding.
            *   Manages the AVCPP `CodecContext` and related objects.

        *   `Renderer`:
            *   `render(const av::VideoFrame& frame)`:  Takes a decoded frame, converts it to an OpenGL texture (if necessary), and renders it to the screen using GLFW and OpenGL.
            *    handles the initialization of glfw and opengl

        *   `gl_helper`
            *    `createTextureFromFrame`: function to create a GL texture from an av:VideoFrame

4.  **Build System (`CMakeLists.txt`)**

    *   (You have a good starting `CMakeLists.txt`.  You'll need to add the new source files and link against GLFW and OpenGL.)
    *   Make sure to link against `avcodec`, `avformat`, `avutil`, `glfw3`, and OpenGL (`-lGL` on Linux).
    *   Use `capnp compile -oc++` to generate C++ code from your `.capnp` file.
    *   Add the generated `video.capnp.h` and `video.capnp.c++` files to your project.

**Example Workflow (Playing a Video):**

1.  **Server Startup:**
    *   `VideoIndex` scans the video directory and builds its index.
    *   `ServerImpl` starts listening for client connections.

2.  **Client Startup:**
    *   `Client` connects to the server.
    *   `getVideoList` populates playlist
    *   `Client` creates a `PlaylistManager`, `VideoDecoder` and a `Renderer`.

3.  **User Selects a Video:**
    *   The `PlaylistManager` sends an initial `requestStream` to the server, requesting packets starting from PTS 0.
    *   `StreamManager` on server opens video file.
    *   The server's `StreamManager` starts sending `StreamResponse` messages containing `PacketData`.
    *    the server starts preloading

4.  **Decoding and Rendering Loop:**
    *   The client's `update()` function receives `StreamResponse` messages.
    *   `PacketData` is passed to `VideoDecoder::decode()`.
    *   The resulting `av::VideoFrame` is passed to `Renderer::render()`.
    *   `Renderer` updates the OpenGL texture and draws the frame.

5.  **Seeking:**
    *   The user presses a seek key.
    *   The `PlaylistManager` calculates the new target PTS.
    *   The `PlaylistManager` sends a `requestStream` message to the server with the new `startPts`.
    *   The server's `StreamManager` seeks to the new position and resumes sending packets.

6.  **Switching Videos:**
    *    User presses next/prev button
    *    `PlaylistManager` calls `next()`/`previous()`
    *    `PlaylistManager` sends a `requestStream` for the new video's ID, potentially using preloaded data if available.

This outline provides a solid foundation. The key to achieving fast switching is the preloading and the use of `VideoInfo` to avoid unnecessary decoding on the client. The optional `PacketCache` can further improve responsiveness. The use of Cap'n Proto ensures efficient communication. Numbering is provided as requested.
