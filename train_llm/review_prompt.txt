Act as an experienced technical writer and documentation specialist. I need you to review the README file for my project, which is provided below.

The current README contains detailed command references but is missing the introductory and explanatory 'glue' text that ties everything together and makes it easy for a new user to understand the project.

Your task is to:

1.  **Analyze the provided README content** to understand the project's purpose and functionality based on the available commands.
2.  **Identify the missing sections.** This could include, but is not limited to:
    *   A compelling project title and a concise, one-sentence tagline.
    *   A brief, high-level overview of what the project is, what problem it solves, and who it's for.
    *   A "Getting Started" or "Quick Start" guide that walks a user through the initial setup and a simple, common use case.
    *   Introductory text for the command reference section that explains how to interpret the commands.
    *   Any other transitional text needed to make the document flow logically.
3.  **Propose new text for these missing sections.** The tone of the proposed text should be clear, concise, and welcoming to new users.
4.  **Present the output as a complete, revised README file.** Use Markdown for formatting. Please clearly indicate the new sections you have added.

Please review the provided information and generate a more complete and user-friendly README.
